Main:



- this should be the else of the previous if



        if (_mode == null) {

            _mode = Mode.GUI;

        }

DONE

- You should not pass the file to MainWindow, simply call load events in startGUIMode

DONE

Controller:

 OK

Model:

 - in addEvent, >= should be > and also you should throw an exception and notify the error in case of <=

DONE

View:

 - in ControlPanel, and also in all observer classes, bette to register as observer at the end, after initialising the gui, otherwise you might get some unexpected behaviour because you will try to update the gui before initializing it.

DONE

 - in run_sim, when catching the exception you should show the error with a dialog and all enable the buttons

DONE

 - you are loading the contamination images continuously, better cache them in an array of type Image[] so the access is faster

DONE

 - the way you update the lists of vehicles/roads in the dialog in not good. This should be done only when opening the dialog. 



        SCC.setVehList(map.getVehicles());

        SWC.setrList(map.getRoads());

        SCC.updateTime(time);

        SWC.updateTime(time);



   you can store the map in a field, and move the above calls to the corresponding action listeners	

DONE

 - in the dialogs the combobox should not be editable

DONE

 - in the dialogs, the minimum value for the ticks JSpinner should be 1
